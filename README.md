## ServiceUNO Project (Concept):

ServiceUNO will be an application with a web interface; it will eventually be integrated by using hardware such as the raspberry pi. ServiceUNO will collect key data that will be quantified based on key services provided by the server and bartender. This information will also be valuable to businesses; the business will benefit from the data to evaluate customer service experience and improve their services by customer feedback. ServiceUNO will rate the server and feature their great customer service skills to maximize their gaining potential (TIPS).


## Stake Holder

**Customers**

The first idea we come up with this project because we noticed that we all had some bad experiences when we went to the restaurant. Also, the comments that people can usually find on the internet, such as Google or Yelp, are only discussing the food in that restaurant. Hence, we want to create a program that allows the customer to rate the service of the server in the restaurant, so when people visit there, they know what service they can expect from the server and also our program will generate a recommended tipping amount to customers based on their feelings of the services.

**Restaurant business owners**

As a restaurant business owner, he/she might feel unhappy if there is any complaint about the service in the restaurant. A business owner always wants their server providing the best service. With our program, the business owner can know how a customer feels to different servers in the restaurant. For some servers that provide good quality services, the business owner may offer some bonus as a reward. On the other hand, for other servers might provide a bad quality of the service, the restaurant can offer additional training to make them provide better service in the future.


**Servers (restaurants)**

As a server working in the restaurant, they are providing service to customers and customer will tip if they think the service quality is excellent. Hence, servers should always want to know what they are doing good and what they are not. With our program, servers will be able to understand what can they improve with their service, what do customers like and what they don't. When they improve their service quality, customers will be more willing to pay, and servers can receive more tips than they do before.
